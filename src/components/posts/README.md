## Services

### FileUploadService

A service class that handles all file upload operations.

**Key Methods:**

- `uploadFile(file, options)` - Upload a single file
- `uploadFiles(files, options)` - Upload multiple files
- `cancelUpload(fileId)` - Cancel an active upload
- `deleteFile(fileId)` - Delete an uploaded file
- `getFileInfo(fileId)` - Get file metadata

**Features:**

- S3 presigned URL generation
- Upload progress tracking
- File validation
- Error handling
- Upload cancellation
- Concurrent upload support

## Backend Integration

### Lambda Function

The file upload Lambda function (`cdk/lambda/file-upload/index.ts`) handles:

- Presigned URL generation
- File metadata storage in DynamoDB
- Upload completion confirmation
- File deletion
- Access control

**API Endpoints:**

- `POST /files/presigned-url` - Get presigned URL for upload
- `POST /files/complete` - Mark upload as completed
- `GET /files/file/{fileId}` - Get file information
- `DELETE /files/file/{fileId}` - Delete file

### DynamoDB Schema

Files are stored in the main table with the following structure:

```typescript
{
  PK: "FILE#{fileId}",
  SK: "METADATA",
  GSI1PK: "USER#{userId}",
  GSI1SK: "FILE#{uploadedAt}",
  EntityType: "FileMetadata",
  fileId: string,
  filename: string,
  contentType: string,
  size: number,
  uploadedBy: string,
  uploadedAt: string,
  s3Key: string,
  url: string,
  discussionId?: string,
  postId?: string,
  isPublic: boolean,
  status: "uploading" | "completed" | "failed" | "deleted"
}
```

## File Type Support

### Supported File Types

**Images:**

- JPEG/JPG (max 10MB)
- PNG (max 10MB)
- GIF (max 5MB)
- WebP (max 10MB)

**Documents:**

- PDF (max 20MB)
- Plain Text (max 1MB)
- Word Documents (.doc, .docx) (max 10MB)

**Audio:**

- QuickTime (.mov) (max 100MB)

### File Validation

Files are validated on both client and server sides:

1. **Client-side validation:**
   - File type checking
   - File size limits
   - File count limits
   - Filename validation

2. **Server-side validation:**
   - MIME type verification
   - File size enforcement
   - Security scanning (future enhancement)

## Security Features

### Access Control

- User authentication required for all operations
- File ownership verification
- Presigned URL expiration (1 hour)
- Private S3 bucket with restricted access

### Data Protection

- Files stored in private S3 bucket
- Metadata stored in DynamoDB with encryption at rest
- Secure presigned URLs for temporary access
- File deletion with audit trail

## Performance Optimizations

### Upload Performance

- Direct S3 upload using presigned URLs
- Concurrent file uploads
- Progress tracking with minimal overhead
- Efficient error handling

### Display Performance

- Lazy loading for images
- Thumbnail generation (future enhancement)
- CDN integration via CloudFront
- Optimized file metadata queries

## Error Handling

### Client-side Errors

- Network connectivity issues
- File validation failures
- Upload cancellation
- Server errors

### Server-side Errors

- Authentication failures
- Authorization errors
- S3 service errors
- DynamoDB errors

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Run the file upload service tests:

```bash
npm test -- --testPathPattern=FileUploadService.test.ts
```

### Integration Tests

Test the complete upload flow:

```bash
npm test -- --testPathPattern=FileUpload.integration.test.ts
```

### Manual Testing

Use the FileUploadDemo component for manual testing:

1. Start the development server
2. Navigate to the demo page
3. Test various file types and sizes
4. Verify progress tracking and error handling

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Add these variables to your `.env` file:

```bash
REACT_APP_FILES_BUCKET_NAME=your-files-bucket-name
REACT_APP_API_GATEWAY_URL=your-api-gateway-url
```

### CDK Configuration

The file upload infrastructure is defined in `cdk/lib/owlnest-stack.ts`:

- S3 bucket for file storage
- Lambda function for upload handling
- API Gateway endpoints
- DynamoDB table for metadata

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Image Processing:**
   - Automatic thumbnail generation
   - Image compression and optimization
   - Multiple resolution support

2. **Advanced Security:**
   - Virus scanning integration
   - Content moderation
   - Watermarking for images

3. **Performance Improvements:**
   - Multipart upload for large files
   - Resume interrupted uploads
   - Background upload queue

4. **User Experience:**
   - Drag and drop interface
   - Paste from clipboard
   - Bulk operations

5. **Analytics:**
   - Upload success rates
   - File type usage statistics
   - Storage usage monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Upload fails with 403 error:**
   - Check AWS credentials
   - Verify S3 bucket permissions
   - Ensure presigned URL hasn't expired

2. **File validation errors:**
   - Check file type against allowed types
   - Verify file size limits
   - Ensure filename is valid

3. **Progress not updating:**
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify progress callback implementation
   - Check for JavaScript errors

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode by setting:

```bash
REACT_APP_DEBUG_MODE=true
```

This will provide detailed logging for troubleshooting.
